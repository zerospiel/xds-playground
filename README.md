# XDS PLAYGROUND

## Description

This is an example of XDS server implementation using [envoy-control-plane](https://github.com/envoyproxy/go-control-plane) and [grpc-go XDS package](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/tree/master/xds).

There are some gRPC servers (backends), some XDS management servers (depends on local or k8s versions), and some clients (frontends) that make several RPC calls to the backend. 

All required discovery services (resources) prepared by the XDS management server using `envoy`'s control plane, and every request from the client being resolved by `grpc-go` `xds` resolver. Under the hood, there is some magic that `grpc-go` doing with its `service config`. Check out [proposal-A27][proposal-a27] and [proposal-A28][proposal-a28] for more information about the basic principles of xDS requests and response processing.

The localhost example supports simple and naive emulation of updating/adding new endpoints (just RR through upstreams) to represent scaling/updates within 2 backends.

The k8s example is a more robust way to represent how it will work in your k8s cluster. 

Note that for simplifications both examples produce [config caches](https://github.com/envoyproxy/go-control-plane#resource-caching) of the whole cluster state (in other words â€” `State of the World`). This behaviour can be easily improved because I use [`MuxCache`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/envoyproxy/go-control-plane@v0.9.7/pkg/cache/v2#MuxCache) that combines several [`LinearCache`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/envoyproxy/go-control-plane@v0.9.7/pkg/cache/v2#LinearCache) each of appropriate [`TypeUrl`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/envoyproxy/go-control-plane@v0.9.7/pkg/resource/v2#pkg-constants).

I mostly didn't care about system design of this playground repository, so there is a bunch of boilerplate code. This playground was a kind of research for me, do not shame on me ðŸ¤—

## Usage

### Localhost example

Run the following commands in the root path of the project each in a separate terminal for readability:

```shell
$ make local_server
$ make local_xds_server
$ make local_client_xds # run target local_client_xds_debug to enable grpc verbose output
```

### k8s example

I use `minikube` as a local k8s cluster and `helm` to deploy resources, so you should install them (i.e. on macOS using [brew](https://brew.sh/)):

```shell
$ brew install minikube
$ brew install helm
```

Use the following targets to simply run the whole example, then check out logs to investigate what's going on:

```shell
$ minikube start # start k8s cluster
$ eval $(minikube docker-env) # escape usage of local registry, works only on terminal where you entered this command
$ make deploy # deploy services
```

To undeploy services simply run `make undeploy`.

To check out logs run the following commands:

```shell
$ kubectl logs -lapp=xds-server # xds-server
$ kubectl logs -lapp=backend # backend
$ kubectl logs -lapp=frontend # frontend with grpc debug level
```

## Further steps

The main idea of these examples is to show a quick presentation of how to bake `grpc-go` with its `xds` resolver ([v1.32.0](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-go/releases/tag/v1.32.0) at this moment).

Currently, [locality weight balancing](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/intro/arch_overview/upstream/load_balancing/locality_weight) just doesn't work at all.
This is the predefined behavior mentioned in [the proposal][proposal-a27]:
> Note that the EDS policy will support locality-level weights, but it will not support endpoint-level weights. Providing a mechanism for endpoint-level weighting will be addressed in future work.
